# Neon Blaster (HTML5/Canvas)

**Play locally:** open `index.html` in your browser.  
**Controls:** WASD move • Mouse aim • Click shoot • Shift dash • P pause • M mute

This is a single‑file, high‑graphics canvas shooter with neon glow, particles, screen shake, pickups, and boss waves with multiple patterns. No external assets.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repo (e.g., `neon-blaster`).
2. Upload `index.html` (and this README if you want).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main (/root)**.
4. Wait a bit; your game will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/neon-blaster/`.

## Notes
- If you don't hear audio immediately, click **PLAY** once (browser autoplay policy).
- To reduce effects on low-end devices, I can add a settings toggle on request.
